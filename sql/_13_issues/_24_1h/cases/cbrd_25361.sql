-- Test Cases for CBRD-25361: Fixed the issue where trace information for CTEs and subqueries are not provided.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- These test cases verify the fix for CBRD-25361, ensuring that trace information
-- is correctly outputted for various scenarios involving CTEs and subqueries,
-- including UNION, UNION ALL, DIFFERENCE, DIFFERENCE ALL, INTERSECTION, 
-- INTERSECTION ALL, and combinations of correlated and uncorrelated subqueries.
