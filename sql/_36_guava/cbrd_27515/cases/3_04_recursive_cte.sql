/**
 *  This test case verifies CBRD-27515: a hash join writes the columns and expressions of the node above it,
 *  and that node passes the hash join's list file through instead of reading it again.
 *  AC-3.2 to AC-3.4 and AC-4: statements around a hash join result, and the trace.
 *  TC-3-04: the recursive part of a recursive CTE uses a hash join.
 *
 *  Every sub-case compares its result rows with the answer. Consecutive sub-cases that read the tables
 *  ta, tb, tc and td as they are share them. A sub-case that needs other tables or other rows makes its
 *  own tables, from ta, and drops them.
 *
 *  A sub-case marked "pass through" or "no pass through" is followed by a query that counts, in the trace
 *  of the sub-case, the SCAN (temp ...) lines and those with readrows: 0. A result passed through reads no
 *  row, so the two counts are equal. Without the change every count of pass_through is 0. CTP masks the
 *  digits of a trace, so the counts are read as a result row.
 *
 *  A sub-case marked "trace" also shows its trace: the node tree is the same as without the change.
 *
 *  Sub-cases:
 *    Sub-case     Check                          Case
 *    TC-3-04-01   result, pass through 1 of 3    hash join in the recursive part
