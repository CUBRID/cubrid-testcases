Test Point:
there is expr and subquery in sum, there are unvacuumed data, and uncommitted delete at the same time

NUM_CLIENTS = 2
C1: DELETE FROM tb1 WHERE id%5=0;
C2: SELECT SUM(t1.id) FROM tb1 t1 LEFT OUTER JOIN (SELECT MIN(tb1.col) AS col FROM tb1 WHERE id>5 GROUP BY id%10 ) AS t2 ON t1.col=t2.col  GROUP BY t2.col;
