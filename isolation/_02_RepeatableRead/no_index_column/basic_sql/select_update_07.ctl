Test Case: update & select

Author: Bobo

Test Point:
1. Reading transactions can only have a look at data committed before the transactions began
2. changes committed after the transaction started are never seen

NUM_CLIENTS = 2
C1: select three times - before C2 begin, after C2 commit, after C1 commit. 
C2: update, commit after C1's transaction start
*/

MC: setup NUM_CLIENTS = 2;

C1: set transaction lock timeout INFINITE;
C1: set transaction isolation level repeatable read;

C2: set transaction lock timeout INFINITE;
C2: set transaction isolation level repeatable read;

/* preparation */
C1: drop table if exists t1;

C1: commit work;
MC: wait until C1 ready;

/* test case */
