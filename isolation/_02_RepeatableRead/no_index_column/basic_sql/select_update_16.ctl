Test Case: update & select

Author: Bobo

Test Point:
1. Reading transactions can only have a look at data committed before the transactions began
2. Uncommitted data or changes committed after the transaction started are never seen;
3. The only visible uncommitted data are the effects of current transaction's dates, that is to say
   the new version is only visible to the current transaction
C1, C3 select; C2, C4 update, no-overlap

NUM_CLIENTS = 4
C1: select on table t1, commited 
C2: update on table t1, commited
C3: select on table t1. there are two versions for the specific rows.
C4: update on table t1, not commited
