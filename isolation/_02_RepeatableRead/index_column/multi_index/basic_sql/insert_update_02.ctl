Test Point:
-    Insert: X_LOCK on first key OID for unique indexes. 
-    Update: X_LOCK acquired on current instance 
there are overlap between C1 and C2
two index, unique index and chr function index on the same column

NUM_CLIENTS = 2

C1: insert into t select rownum,rownum+70 from (select sleep(1)) x, t where id>0 limit 3; --expected blocked
C2: update t set col=col+1 where chr(col)>'A' and 0=(select sleep (1)) using index idx;
