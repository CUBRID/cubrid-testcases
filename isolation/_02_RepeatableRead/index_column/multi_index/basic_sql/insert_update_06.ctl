Test Point:
-    Insert: X_LOCK on first key OID for unique indexes. 
-    Update: X_LOCK acquired on current instance 
there are overlap between C1 and C2
two index, unique index and non unique index

C1: insert into t select rownum,rownum ||'a' from (select sleep(2)) x, t limit 3; --expected blocked
C2: update t set col=col||'a' where id>0 and sleep(1,id) using index idx;
