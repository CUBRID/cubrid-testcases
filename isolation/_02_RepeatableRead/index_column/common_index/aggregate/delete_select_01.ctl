Test Case: delete & select
Priority: 1
Reference case:
Author: Lily

Test Point:
Reading queries can only have a look at data committed before the transaction began
changes committed after the transaction started are never seen
there are many unvacuum version, test select sum(id) correctness
Combination:
a) some user committed before the query begin 
b) some begin before the select begin, but commit after the select begin 
c) some begin before the select begin, commit after the select end 
d) some begin after the select begin, commit before the select end 
e) some begin after the select begin, commit after the select end
