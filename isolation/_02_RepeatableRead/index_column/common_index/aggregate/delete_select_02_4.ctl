/*
Test Case: delete & select
Priority: 2
Reference case: cc_basic/_01_ReadCommitted/index_column/common_index/aggregate/delete_select_02.ctl
Author: Lily

Test Point:
Reading queries can only have a look at data committed before the transaction began
changes committed after the transaction started are never seen
there are many unvacuum version, test select distinct correctness
Combination 
a) some user committed before the transaction begin 
b) some begin before the transaction begin, but rollback after the transaction begin 
c) some begin before the transaction begin, commit after the transaction end 
d) some begin after the transaction begin, commit before the transaction end 
e) some begin after the transaction begin, commit after the transaction end
