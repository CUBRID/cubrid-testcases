Test Case: update & update
Priority: 1
Reference case:
Author: Mandy

Test Point:
A target record may be already locked and modified (updated or deleted) by another transaction. In this case:
1. C1 will lock all the rows one by one
2. C2 will lock the last row after C1 starts and before C1 locks it
Even C1 and C2 have overlaps and C2 starts after C1 starts, C2 is not blocked by C1. However, C1 is blocked by C2 when C1 try to get the lock of the last row. 
3. C2 rollback, C1 get the lock, update.

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: update all the rows one by one; blocked; update
C2: update the last row after C1 starts and before C1 lock the last row; rollback
C3: select on table t1, and C3 is used to check the update result
