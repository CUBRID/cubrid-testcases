Test Case: delete & delete 
Priority: 1
Reference case:
Author: Ray
Function: ROWNUM(INST_NUM)

Test Plan: 
Test MVCC DELETE scenarios (locks - X_LOCK on instance) if using ROWNUM function (ROWNUM/INST_NUM) in delete queries where clause, 
and the affected rows are not overlapped

Test Scenario:
C1 delete, C2 delete, the selected rows are not overlapped (based on where clause)
C1,C2 only use ROWNUM in their where clauses
C1 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: data size = small, index = no index, where clause = simple, schema = single table

Test Point:
1) C1 and C2 will not be waiting 
2) All the instances of C1 and C2 will be deleted

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: delete from table t1;   
C2: delete from table t1;
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the updated result

C2: set transaction lock timeout INFINITE;
