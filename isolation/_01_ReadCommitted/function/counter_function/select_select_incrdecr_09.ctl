/*
Test Case: select & select 
Priority: 1
Reference case:
Author: Ray
Function: INCR/DECR

Test Plan: 
Test MVCC SELECT scenarios (locks - IX_LOCK) if using click counter function (INCR/DECR) in select queries, 
and the affected rows are not overlapped, C2 select does affect C1 select
C1 select takes a long time (finishes the execution after C2 commit)

Test Scenario:
C1 select, C2 select, the selected rows are not overlapped (based on where clause)
C1 uses INCR and C2 uses INCR
C2 select does affect C1 select
C1 select takes a long time (finishes the execution after C2 commit)
C2 commit, C1 commit
Metrics: data size = small, index = no index, where clause = simple, schema = single table

Test Point:
1) C1 and C2 will not be waiting 
2) C2 instances will be updated(increment) first
   C1 instances will be updated(increment) based on its original snapshot 

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: select incr from table t1;   
C2: select incr from table t1;  
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the final results
