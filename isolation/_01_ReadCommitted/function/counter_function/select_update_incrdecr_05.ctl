/*
Test Case: select & update 
Priority: 1
Reference case:
Author: Ray
Function: INCR/DECR

Test Plan: 
Test MVCC SELECT/UPDATE scenarios if using click counter function (INCR/DECR) in select query, 
and the affected rows are not overlapped, C2 update does affect C1 select, 
C1 finished execution after C2 completed since C1 takes a long time 

Test Scenario:
C1 select, C2 update, the affected rows are not overlapped (based on where clause)
C1 uses INCR
C2 update does affect C1 select
C1 finished execution after C2 completed since C1 takes a long time 
C2 commit, C1 commit
Metrics: data size = small, index = no index, where clause = simple, schema = single table

Test Point:
1) C1 and C2 will not be waiting 
2) C2 instances will be updated first 
   C1 instances will be updated(increment) based on its original search condition(snapshot) 

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: select incr from table t1;   
C2: update table t1;  
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the final results
