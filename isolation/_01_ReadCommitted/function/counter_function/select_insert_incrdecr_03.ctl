/*
Test Case: select & insert 
Priority: 1
Reference case:
Author: Ray
Function: INCR/DECR

Test Plan: 
Test MVCC SELECT/INSERT scenarios if using click counter function (INCR/DECR) in select query 
C2 insert does affect C1 select, C1 finishes execution after C2 completes since C1 takes a long time  

Test Scenario:
C1 select, C2 insert,
C2 insert does affect C1 select
C1 finishes execution after C2 completes since C1 takes a long time 
C2 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: data size = small, index = no index, where clause = simple, schema = single table

Test Point:
1) C1 and C2 will not be waiting 
2) C2 instances will be inserted first
   C1 instances will be updated(increment) based on its original snapshot 

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: select from table t1;   
C2: insert into table t1;  
C3: select on table t1; C3 is used to check the final results
