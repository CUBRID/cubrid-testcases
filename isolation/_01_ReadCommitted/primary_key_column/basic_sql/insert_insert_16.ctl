Test Point:
-    Insert: X_LOCK on first key OID for unique indexes.
insert many column at the same time
A: insert into ... select ... from ...
B: insert one row
there is overlap

NUM_CLIENTS = 2

C2: insert into t values(2,'b');
C1: rollback
C2: commit

C1: set transaction isolation level read committed;

/* preparation */
