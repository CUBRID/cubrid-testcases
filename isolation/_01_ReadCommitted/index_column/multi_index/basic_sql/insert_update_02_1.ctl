Test Point:
-    Insert: X_LOCK on first key OID for unique indexes. 
-    Update: X_LOCK acquired on current instance 
there are overlap between C1 and C2
two index, unique index and chr function index on the same column

C1: set @newincr=0;
C1: insert into t select (@newincr:=@newincr+1),(@newincr)+70 from t where chr(col)>='A' and (select sleep(1)=0)<>0 limit 3;
C2: update t set col=col+1 where chr(col)>'A';
