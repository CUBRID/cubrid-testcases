Test Case: delete & select
Priority: 1

Author: Lily

Test Point:
1. Reading queries can only have a look at data committed before the queries began
2. Uncommitted data or changes committed after the query started are never seen

NUM_CLIENTS = 2 
C1: select * from tb1 order by 1,2;
   C2: delete from tb1; 
   C2: commit;
C1: commit;
