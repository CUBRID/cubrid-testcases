Author: Lily

Test Point:
-    delete: X_LOCK acquired on current instance..
-    select: no row locks acquired but IS_LOCK for table,
             but can see rows before the queries began.
C1 select rows, C2 delete rows, overlapped.
transactions are not blocked.

C1: SELECT * FROM tb1 order by 1,2;
C2: DELETE FROM tb1 WHERE id <= 3;
