/*
Test Case: Changing Owner
Priority: 1
Reference case:
Author: Bobo

Test Plan: 
Test update locks (X_LOCK on instance) and SELECT not need locks, they are not blocked each other.

Test Scenario:
C1 granting authorization, C2 verify authorization, 
C1 verify authorization, 
C1 commit, C2 commit, 
Metrics: data size = small, where clause = simple (multiple columns)

Test Point:
1) C1 and C2 will not be waiting 
2) All the data affected from C1 and C2 should be deleted

NUM_CLIENTS = 2
C1: granting authorization - verify authorization;  
C2: verify authorization;
