Test Case: update & insert
Priority: 1
Reference case:
Author: Bobo

Test Plan: 
Test update locks (X_LOCK on instance) and SELECT not need locks, they are not blocked each other.

Test Scenario:
C1 select, C2 update, C2 delete the affected rows are overlapped
C1 insert, C2 delete
C1 commit, C2 commit
Metrics: data size = small, join query = left join, where clause = simple (multiple columns)

Test Point:
1) C1 and C2 will not be waiting 
2) All the data affected from C1 and C2 should be deleted

NUM_CLIENTS = 3
C1: select - insert - delete;  
C2: update - select - delete;
